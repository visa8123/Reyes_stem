### **Simulate a reinforcement learning agent taking safe actions based on risk levels.**

#### Problem Statement:

Space missions involve unpredictable conditions and varying levels of risk. A system must learn to

- Proceed during low risk
- Wait during moderate risk
- Abort during high risk

This project uses **Q-learning**, a classic RL algorithm to train an agent to take decisions based on a simulated environment.
